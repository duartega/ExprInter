What Works:

arrays are completely working -- input1.txt , input2.txt
functions are working with general return values and recursion -- input1.txt , input2.txt

What Doesn't Work:

return values within if statements or for loops will not break out of the functions

Notes:

running this on Clion works perfectly fine but running on BLUE with a make file crashes. Don't know why.
Please test on CLion!
